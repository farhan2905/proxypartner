  { question: "What makes your approach different from other agencies?", answer: "We don't believe in cookie-cutter solutions or endless jargon. Our approach is entirely data-driven and tailored specifically to your goals. We act as an extension of your team, providing complete transparency and measurable results from day one." },
  { question: "How long does it take to see tangible results?", answer: "While every business is unique, our agile methodologies typically deliver initial quick wins within the first 30-45 days. Long-term, sustainable growth strategies usually mature around the 3-6 month mark, depending on market conditions and your industry." },
  { question: "Do you work with startups or established enterprises?", answer: "Both. We have scaled startups from zero to seven figures and have helped established enterprises optimize their operations and revitalize their digital presence. Our strategies scale and adapt to your current stage of growth." },
  { question: "What is your pricing structure?", answer: "We offer flexible, value-based pricing rather than strict hourly billing. Depending on the project scope, we provide clear milestone-based pricing or monthly retainers for ongoing growth partnerships. Everything is transparent before we start." },
  { question: "Can you help integrate AI into our existing workflows?", answer: "Absolutely. We specialize in identifying bottlenecks and implementing custom AI solutions that automate repetitive tasks, enhance data analysis, and improve overall operational efficiency without disrupting your core business." },
